break down the JavaScript code :

1. **Variables**:

   - `inputBox`: This variable holds the reference to the input element with the id "input-box".
   - `listContainer`: This variable holds the reference to the unordered list element with the id "list-container".

2. **addTask() function**:
   - This function is called when the user clicks the "add" button.
   - It first checks if the input box is empty. If it is, it displays an alert prompting the user to type something.
   - If the input box is not empty, it creates a new list item (`

li`) element and sets its innerHTML to the value entered in the input box.

- It then appends this new list item to the `listContainer`.
- Additionally, it creates a cross (`\u00d7`) symbol inside a `span` element, which will be used for removing the task.
- This cross symbol is appended to the newly created list item.

3. **Event Listener**:

   - An event listener is added to the `listContainer` element, listening for click events.
   - When a click event occurs:
     - If the clicked element is a list item (`LI`), it toggles the "checked" class on that list item. This class is responsible for striking through the text to mark it as completed.
     - If the clicked element is a `SPAN`, it removes the parent list item from the list. This is done by accessing the parent element of the `SPAN` (which is the `LI`) and then removing it.

4. **saveData() function**:

   - This function is responsible for saving the current state of the to-do list in the browser's `localStorage`.
   - It stores the HTML content of the `listContainer` element in the localStorage under the key "data".

5. **showTask() function**:
   - This function retrieves the saved data from localStorage and displays it in the `listContainer` when the page is refreshed.
   - It retrieves the HTML content stored under the key "data" in localStorage and sets it as the innerHTML of the `listContainer`.

Overall, this JavaScript code handles adding tasks to the to-do list, marking tasks as completed, removing tasks, and persisting the state of the to-do list across page refreshes using localStorage.
